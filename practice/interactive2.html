        <h2>why I like WarThunder and what its about</h2>
        <h6>by Dominik Garces</h6>
        <p>WarThunder is kindof like a first person shooter and is lots of tank plane and (sometimes) boat fun</p>
        <p>countries you can paly </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Amarica</li>
            <li>Russa/USSR</li>
            <li>Italy</li>
            <li>Britain</li>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>Germany</li>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>China</li>
            <li>Israel</li>

        </ul>
        <p>In war thunder you play against/with other people in your region/country(so you can communicate with them over a chat) in a live battle. When you start out<br> you can choose between tanks, planes or Battleships and start researching certain countries(keep in mind these are real tanks that actually existed or were<br> almost mass produced). in warthunder you can play in and start out with simple tanks like the LVT which is an american amphibious tank or if your a <br> plane you can be a BF 2-C1 and you fight in a realistic map (the cool thing is an actual battle probably happened there during ww2)as you get kills and <br> survive treacherous battles you can get your own first vehicle(yipeeee) now you can fight in higher ranking battles. As you go on and progress further into the game you get stronger tanks and more experienced players to fight
This is a very little poorly described description of warthunder
