        <h3>why tanks?</h3>
        <p> So why tank. well because I like tanks and there really cool. also because tank have been through a very interestiong evelution of new invetions and the compresion of divises. they also have been influenced by the new invetions of new weapons and the need for diferent tasks, 
            like the <u>valentine</u> wich somtimes was somtimes fitted with a scissor bridge attatchment. also the <u>M7 Priest</u> is used for tasks that artillery would do.</p>
