            <h2>Why tanks?</h2>
            <p> So why tank. well because I like tanks and they have really cool history. also because tank have been through a very interestiong evelution of new invetions and the compresion of divises.<br> they also have been influenced by the new invetions of new weapons and the need for diferent tasks,
            like the <u>valentine</u> wich somtimes was somtimes fitted with a scissor bridge attatchment.<br> also the <u>M7 Priest</u> is used for tasks that artillery would do. </p><br>

        </div>
            <p>so when did tanks come around well the oldest tank bluprint we have found was made by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_fighting_vehicle" target="_blank"> leonardo di vici </a>, but the first actually 
            built tank that made it into battle was the <u>m1(mark 1)</u>. this was <br> then fallowed by the german <u>Sturmpanzerwagen A7V</u>(germans and there names). this pattern was the start of all tanks, build a tank then try to improve or make it better, but this got use some <br> 
            strange tanks like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Tank" target="_blank"> Tsar tank </a> and these are only a few of the first tanks from WW1 to the end of WW1</p>
