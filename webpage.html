        <h2>Why tanks?</h2>
        <p> So why tank. well because I like tanks and they have really cool history. also because tank have been through a very interestiong evelution of new invetions and the compresion of divises. they also have been influenced by the new invetions of new weapons and the need for diferent tasks, <br>
            like the <u>valentine</u> wich somtimes was somtimes fitted with a scissor bridge attatchment. also the <u>M7 Priest</u> is used for tasks that artillery would do. so when did tanks come around well the oldest tank bluprint we have found was made by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_fighting_vehicle" target="_blank"> leonardo di vici </a> leonardo di vici, but the first actually <br>
            built tank that made it into battle was the <u>m1(mark 1)</u></p>
